# Purchase_Predictions
My task here is to recommend the marketing team a better set of possible customers to focus on who have higher chance of purchasing based on given features. 

 Inorder to achieve that, I need to train my ML algorithm on given dataset and train a model based on mapping of input features and target output, which in my case is given set of input feature vectors does a client does a purchase or Not.

One thing needs to be clear before I proceed ahead is that my problem statement is a Classification problem, where given training sample I will tune my model to test on unknown samples.
